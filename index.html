			<p>Hello from Fur Babies Online, we are a newly opened shop in the South Tampa/Hyde Park district
				catering mainly to the canine community. But, that doesn't mean that some of our accessories couldn't work
				for your other four legged kids. Sniff through our site, we have a few products available, dog walking
				and grooming services, and special events, with all proceeds going to the Humane Society of Tampa.</p>

				<div class="home-image-container">

						This could be your pupper after a day with us!

			<p>Fur Babies is owned and operated by Janie McFrizzle, established the Summer of 2017. Janie is an animal
				lover through and through, and opened Fur Babies with the mind to offer hospitality and the essential accessories
				that your pup needs. We at Fur Babies look to offer nothing but the best atmosphere for you and your pup while
				with us. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
