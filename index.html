          Hello from Fur Babies Online, we are a newly opened shop in the South
          Tampa/Hyde Park district catering mainly to the canine community. But,
          that doesn't mean that some of our accessories couldn't work for your
          other four legged kids. Sniff through our site, we have a few products
          available, dog walking and grooming services, and special events, with
          all proceeds going to the Humane Society of Tampa.
        </p>
